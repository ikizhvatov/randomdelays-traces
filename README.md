# Trace sets with random delays

This repository contains tracesets from the following paper:

[Jean-Sébastien Coron and Ilya Kizhvatov. An Efficient Method for Random Delay Generation in Embedded Software. CHES 2009](https://www.iacr.org/archive/ches2009/57470156/57470156.pdf)

The trace sets were obtained from an 8-bit AVR microcontroller. The details on the measurement setup and the implementation are in the paper and in Sections 2.6.1 and 6.9 of [the thesis](https://www.iacr.org/phds/106_IlyaKizhvatov_PhysicalSecurityCryptographicA.pdf).


* `ctraces_fm16x4_2.mat` - AES-128 with random delays generated using the Floating mean method. Encryption key: `2b7e151628aed2a6abf7158809cf4f3c`. These power traces are compressed by selecting 1 sample (peak) of each CPU clock cycle. At least the first (non-dummy) AES round is covered.

To get the traces by cloning the repo you need [Git LFS](https://git-lfs.github.com). Alternatively, you can download the traces directly from GitHub web interface.
